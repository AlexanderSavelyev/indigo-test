# Summary

One paragarph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support?
What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the service internals to understand and implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how
the feature is used.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
