Indigo 1.1.4
----------
* Allene stereocenters detection algorithm is not throwing exception in case there are not atom coordinates
* Aromatic [si] can be loaded from SMILES
* Dearomatization improvements for B, Si, P atoms. There was an issue that the dearomatization method didn't work with the molecule CB1OB(C)OB(C)O1 if it was loaded from SMILES in aromatic form.

New methods:

* setExplicitValence.
* radical, setRadical. This methods returns and accepts Indigo.SINGLET, Indigo.DOUBLET or Indigo.TRIPLET radicals.

Thanks to Ferenc for suggestions to add these methods: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/indigo-general/NBqNZ4Ik4-Y/goMuQxL9ZkEJ>

with the standard utility occurs when stereochemistry is defined not in a proper way. Allenes and 
cumulenes are not supported yet.

* new RGroup-Decomposition API was added: createDecomposer(), addDecomposition(), decomposeMolecule(), iterateDecompositions()  
See more details at <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-general/browse_thread/thread/75281df2f70ec1a>
Thanks to Gerhard: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-general/browse_thread/thread/c1dbc67ece5f78b0>,  
Mederich: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-general/browse_thread/thread/6d77029359364dd8>, and  
Simon: <http://tech.knime.org/forum/indigo/r-group-decomposer>

* We completely switched to CMake project configurations.

Changes:

* AAM new algorithm heuristic was implemented for disconnected reactant and product molecules.
* correctReactingCenters() method was added for reactions. It highlights bond reacting centers according to AAM.  
Thanks to James: <http://tech.knime.org/forum/indigo/reaction-automapper-bond-highlighting>
* "timeout" option is used for MCS computation.

Fixes:

* The bug with aam for query reactions was fixed
* The bug with aam timeout was fixed.  
Thanks to Daniel: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-bugs/browse_thread/thread/1cc5b9dffd740240>
* clearStereocenters() method now resets bond directions. After calling this method molecule is saved into Molfile format without tetrahedral bond directions.
* Exception during saving Molfile with pseudoatoms within aromatic rings
* Exception when loading a molecule from Molfile with 3D coordinates with invalid valences during automatic stereocenters detection.
* Some other issues.

Indigo 1.1-beta10
----------

Changes:

* IndigoObject is Java now have dispose() method to dispose Indigo object before garbage collection.
* Molfile atom lists now support pseudoatoms
* Global timeout for all the most time consuming operations: substructure search, canonical smiles generation and etc. Option is called "timeout" and corresponts to milliseconds.
* explicit hydrogen near Nitrogen is handled correctly to calculate cis-trans and tetrahedral stereo configuration.
* InChI plugin now have "version" methods to return an actual InChI implementation version
* Arial font is used on Linux systems to render molecules. Previously this font was used only on Windows and Mac OS X, and rendered images on Windows and Linux were different.
* "deco-ignore-errors" option was added. Now there are no exceptions like 'no embeddings obtained' during the RGroup Decomposition if the flag set true. Exception is raised only for the end getters (e.g. decomposedMoleculeWithRGroups())
* "deco-save-ap-bond-orders" option was added. Within the option output molecule RGroup attachment points are saved as pseudo atoms (named 'AP1', 'AP2' etc). Therefore, the option allows to save initial bond orders.  
Thanks to Mederich: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-general/browse_thread/thread/c4bca8b97ca54a87>
* bug with the time hang was fixed for AAM.

----------

Changes:

* if a molecule contains only R-group #2 then empty R-rgroup #1 is not rendered any more.
* molecules with bad valences and charges can be serialized now
* timeout option was added for AAM. A new option was added named "aam-timeout". The integer parameter (time in milliseconds) corresponds for the AAM algorithm working time. The automap method returns a current state solution for a reaction when time is over. Thanks to Daniel: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-dev/browse_thread/thread/4430412b9864f3fd>
* default layout call was added for the deconvolultion scaffold getter (decomposedMoleculeScaffold())

Indigo 1.1-beta8
----------

We have released our first version of InChI plugin that allows to load InChI strings and generate InChI and InChIKey for molecules (this version discards stereoinformation, but we are working on it). The plugin is statically linked with the official InChI library and can be loaded on demand, as it is done with IndigoRenderer plugin.

Usage example :

    IndigoInchi inchi = new IndigoInchi(indigo);
    IndigoObject molecule = indigo.loadMolecule("InChI=1S/C3H9NO/c1-3(5)2-4/h3,5H,2,4H2,1H3");
    String inchi_string = indigo.getInchi(molecule);

New methods and functionallity:

* InChI support! (without stereochemistry yet)
* mapMolecule(queryReactoinMolecule) to retrieve mapped molecule for the query reaction for the reaction substrcuture match object
* getMolecule(index) to get the reaction molecule
* QueryMolecules can now be constructed with the following methods:

    1. addAtom, resetAtom methods for the QueryMolecule now parses arbitrary SMARTS
    2. addBond method for QueryMolecule
    3. atom.addConstraintOr method has been added
    4. a lot of query atom constraints: atomic-number, charge, isotope, radical, valence, connectivity, total-bond-order, hygrogens, substituents, ring, smallest-ring, ring-bonds, rsite-mask

Fixed: 

* Issue with loading molecule attachment points if the bond orders are not marked.
* Better handling of molecules with invalid valence: canonical SMILES, unfoldHydrogens, invalid stereocenters detection. Thanks to Mederich for the bug report: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-bugs/browse_thread/thread/8f1ac4c1bfcbc346>
* Molecule serialization with more than 8 R-groups. Thanks to James Davidson for the bug report: <http://tech.knime.org/forum/indigo/changes-to-scaffold-finder-node>

   Thanks to Ernst-Georg Schmid: <http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-general/browse_thread/thread/ffe48381a01f7d24>
   And to Daniel Lowe:
<http://groups.google.com/group/indigo-bugs/browse_thread/thread/11373837ba65acd>
 
 * Improvements in the molecule decomposition algorithm.
 
 * Python 2.4 support.
 
 * A lot of bugs has been fixed due to some internal inconsistency in explicit hydrogens handing for cis-trans bonds:
 
      - Substructure matcher result can be incorrect for matching query molecule with cis-trans bonds.
      - Substructure matcher result can be incorrect in case of explicit hydrogens for cis-trans bonds in the target molecule.
      - If a molecule has explicit hydrogens near cis-trans bonds, after been unserialized cis-trans configuration might flip.
      - Canonical SMILES may also produce different results for a molecule with explicit hydrogens and without them.  

		
 * Better stability of Indigo Java wrapper	
 
 * Better rendering of a SMARTS query molecules

    Code example: atom = mol.addRSite("R1")

Fixed:

  * foldHydrogens on [H][H] and molecules with isotopic
